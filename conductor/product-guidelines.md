# Product Guidelines: Boran Corporate Website

These guidelines define the verbal, visual, and structural standards for the Boran corporate website refactor, ensuring a consistent and professional identity that distinguishes Boran as a premier localized service provider.

## 1. Verbal Tone & Messaging
**Core Principle: Expert & Practical**
- **Tone:** The voice should be authoritative yet accessible. Avoid overly abstract marketing jargon. Instead, focus on clear, actionable insights and the "how-to" of digital implementation.
- **Language:** **Simplified Chinese** is the primary language. The style should be professional, precise, and tailored to local regional business decision-makers.
- **Brand Positioning:** Explicitly use the narrative **"Empowered by Yonyou, Enhanced by Boran."** Position Boran as the essential bridge that transforms standardized Yonyou software into tailored, high-value local business solutions.

## 2. Visual Identity
**Core Principle: Authentic & Trustworthy**
- **Imagery:** Prioritize **Authentic Imagery**. Use high-quality, professional photographs of real implementation scenarios, local Boran teams, and genuine client interactions. Avoid generic, sterile stock photography that feels disconnected from the local market.
- **Color Palette & Ratio:** The UI design must strictly adhere to the following color distribution:
    - **70% White/Gray:** Used for backgrounds, whitespace, and primary layout areas to create a clean, professional, and expansive feel.
    - **20% Blue:** Used for secondary elements, navigation, icons, and branding accents to represent trust, stability, and the Yonyou ecosystem connection.
    - **10% Red:** Used sparingly for primary Calls-to-Action (CTAs), critical alerts, or strategic highlights to draw attention and drive conversion.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a **Strict & Uniform** UI layout. While the content changes across different industry solutions, the structural components must adhere to a rigid design system to reinforce the corporate "trustworthy" aesthetic and professional stability.

## 3. Structural & UI Principles
- **Layout Consistency:** Every page should feel like a part of a unified ecosystem. Use standardized headers, spacing, and typography to create a sense of established reliability.
- **Scenario Focus:** The structure should prioritize the presentation of "Industry Solutions" and "Success Stories," using a consistent content hierarchy to make information easily digestible for potential clients.

## 4. Key Messaging Pillars
- **Scenario-Based Expertise:** Always ground product features in real-world business scenarios.
- **Localized Support:** Highlight the benefit of having expert implementation and service teams physically present in the region.
- **Implementation Excellence:** Emphasize the specialized methodology Boran uses to ensure successful project delivery.
