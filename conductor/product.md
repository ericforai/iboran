# Product Guide: Boran Corporate Website Refactor

## Initial Concept
Existing Boran corporate website based on Payload CMS website template. This is a refactoring project initiated on December 20, 2025.

## Core Identity
**Boran is a professional implementation service provider within the Yonyou ecosystem.**
- **Differentiation:** Unlike Yonyou, which provides standardized products, Boran specializes in **scenario-based implementation and localized services**.
- **User Perception:** Visitors must immediately recognize Boran as an independent, specialized service provider, not a Yonyou replica.

## Target Audience
**Primary:**
- **Potential ERP/SaaS Buyers:** Businesses seeking enterprise software solutions who prioritize hands-on, localized support and specialized implementation over generic vendor interactions.

## Key Content Strategy
To demonstrate "Scenario-based Implementation" expertise:
- **Industry Solutions:** Detailed pages showcasing specific implementation scenarios (e.g., Finance, Supply Chain, Manufacturing) that highlight Boran's unique value-add over standard products.
- **Customer Success Stories:** Localized case studies emphasizing how Boran successfully tailors and implements standardized products for specific regional businesses.

## Conversion Strategy (CTAs)
- **Request a Solution Proposal:** Forms for users to describe their specific business scenario and receive a customized plan.
- **Book a Local Service Consultation:** Options for direct scheduling of localized support or in-person meetings.
- **Download Implementation Case Studies:** Gated content offering deep dives into success stories to capture high-intent leads.

## Design & Tone
**"Professional Agility"**
- A strategic balance between **Solid & Trustworthy (A)** and **Innovative & Accessible (B)**.
- **Visuals:** Maintain the professional stability expected in the enterprise software space (aligned with Yonyou's reliability) but infuse it with a modern, approachable aesthetic that signals Boran's agility and "hands-on" service nature.
- **Goal:** To look established enough to be trusted with critical systems, but distinct enough to be seen as a responsive, local partner rather than a distant corporation.
